**CST8913 Cloud Migration – Lab 6**
**Thomas de Haan Carriere**
This lab focused on cloud services offered by the three largest cloud providers: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Thirty use cases were analyzed to identify the corresponding cloud service from each provider that best met the criteria. Comparisons were then performed between the services offered by each provider for select use cases.
For use case #3, AWS and Google Cloud provide Amazon RDS and Google Cloud SQL, which are both capable of supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. Azure does not offer a single standalone service that supports all three database systems; therefore, several services would need to be employed. Azure SQL Database can be used for SQL Server, Azure Database for MySQL to manage MySQL databases, and Azure Database for PostgreSQL to manage PostgreSQL databases.
For use case #25, AWS and Azure both provide DaaS offerings with Amazon WorkSpaces and Azure Virtual Desktop, respectively. Google Cloud does not provide a strongly equivalent standalone service; however, by pairing Google Compute Engine (GCE) with a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure provider, a similar outcome can be achieved. One potential benefit of a Google Cloud solution is that GCE provides very granular control of resources, allowing clients to optimize virtual machines for their needs and potentially reduce hosting costs.
For use case #30, AWS offers Simple Notification Service (SNS), which provides support for SMS, email, and push notifications to devices, whereas Azure and Google do not provide a single service with all these capabilities. For Azure, a combination of Azure Notification Hubs for push notifications and app alerts, along with Azure Communication Services for SMS and email, can be used to cover the requirements. Google provides Firebase Cloud Messaging, which can send push notifications to devices; however, Google does not provide a strong native service for real-time communication via SMS and email. In this case, a third-party service such as Twilio can be used along with Firebase Cloud Messaging to bridge the gap in requirements.
The naming conventions used for each service depend upon the provider. AWS often uses more abstract names with deeper meaning for their services, while Azure and Google tend to use more straightforward, descriptive names. An example from AWS would be Elastic Beanstalk, their PaaS service for deploying and scaling web applications. “Elastic” refers to the service’s ability to automatically scale, whereas “Beanstalk” suggests a clear path to grow and develop an application, inspired by the fairy tale “Jack and the Beanstalk.” An example from Google would be Pub/Sub, which, as the name implies, offers a fully managed publisher/subscriber model for communication. An example from Azure would be Azure Virtual Machines, which clearly describes the service used to create virtual machines hosted on their infrastructure. For clarity and unambiguity, Azure appears to have the most consistent and easily understandable naming conventions.
